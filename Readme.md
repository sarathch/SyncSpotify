Author : Sarath 

SyncSpotify is a simple project to connect to Spotify's Web API.

SyncSpotify fetches Client Credentials Auth token during AUthorization step.

SyncSpotify queries on album list available on Spotify using the fetched CC Access Token.

TO-DOs:
1. Implementing refresh token mechanism on expiry
2. Few small error message handling needs to be done on SyncSpotify View.
